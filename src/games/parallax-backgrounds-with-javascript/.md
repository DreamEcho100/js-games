# Seamless Scrolling Backgrounds in JavaScript

**‚û§ "Approach 1", "Approach 2", and "Approach 3:"** Each of these is a way to **scroll an image seamlessly in a loop** (like a background layer in a game).  

---

## üß† Before We Begin: The Goal

You have a background image (`img`) that's, say, `800px` wide, and your canvas is also 800px wide.  
You want the image to scroll **left**, and once it's fully gone, **loop it back around**.

---

## ‚úÖ Approach 1: **Double Buffering with Two Images**

```js
this.x1 = 0;
this.x2 = this.width; // second copy of the image starts right after the first

// In update():
this.x1 -= this.speed;
this.x2 -= this.speed;

if (this.x1 < -this.width) this.x1 = this.width + this.x2 - this.speed;
if (this.x2 < -this.width) this.x2 = this.width + this.x1 - this.speed;

// In draw():
ctx.drawImage(this.img, this.x1, 0);
ctx.drawImage(this.img, this.x2, 0);
```

### üé® ASCII Explanation

```_
Frame 1:
[x1: 0     ] [x2: 800   ]  <-- both drawn
|----------|----------|

Frame 2 (after scroll left):
[x1: -5    ] [x2: 795   ]
|----------|----------|

Eventually:
[x1: -800  ] [x2: 0     ]  <-- x1 is offscreen
|----------|----------|

Then:
[x1: 800   ] [x2: 0     ]  <-- reset x1
|----------|----------|
```

üí° **Good for**: always keeping **two images in memory** and manually handling both.
<br>‚úÖ Smoothest and most reliable.  
üì¶ Slightly more memory and code.

---

## ‚úÖ Approach 2: **Single Image + Draw Twice Trick**

```js
this.x1 -= this.speed;
if (this.x1 < -this.width) this.x1 = 0;

// In draw():
ctx.drawImage(this.img, this.x1, 0);
ctx.drawImage(this.img, this.x1 + this.width, 0);
```

### üé® ASCII Explanation

```_
Canvas width: 800
Image width: 800

[x1: 0     ] [x1 + width: 800]  <-- draws the second one right after the first
|----------|----------|

[x1: -5    ] [795]
|----------|----------|

Eventually:
[x1: -800  ] [0]
|----------|----------|

Then:
[x1 reset to 0] and repeat
```

üí° **Good for**: simpler code, just track `x1`.  
‚úÖ Memory-efficient.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Needs exact timing or there will be a **flash gap** if `x1` isn't reset *exactly* at `-width`.

---

## ‚úÖ Approach 3: **Frame-Based Modulo Scrolling**

```js
let gameFrame = 0;
this.x1 = (-gameFrame * this.speed) % this.width;
```

### üé® ASCII Explanation

This just relies on how modulo works!

```_
gameFrame = 0 ‚Üí x1 = 0
gameFrame = 1 ‚Üí x1 = -1
gameFrame = 800 ‚Üí x1 = 0 again

=> Seamless loop using %!
```

Imagine this timeline of x1 values:

```_
-0  -1  -2  ... -798  -799  -800 ‚Üí wraps to 0 (since -800 % 800 = 0)
```

üí° **Good for**: predictable, time-based animations.  
‚úÖ Compact and elegant.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Can feel floaty if your `speed` is not frame-rate-adjusted.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è TL;DR Comparison

| Approach | Tracks | Pros | Cons |
|---------|--------|------|------|
| 1       | `x1` + `x2` | Bulletproof, no gaps | More state to manage |
| 2       | `x1` only   | Simple logic        | Needs exact reset timing |
| 3       | `gameFrame` + `%` | Most elegant | Can be hard to tune for frame drops |

## üöÄ So which should *you* use?

- **Approach 1** is best if you're okay with a bit more code and want precise control.
- **Approach 2** is great when you only need one repeat and want simple logic.
- **Approach 3** is great for **constant-time** animations (e.g. independent of canvas size).

Would you like visual diagrams or a live CodePen-like demo for each version?
