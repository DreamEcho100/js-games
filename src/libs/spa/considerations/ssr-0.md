Islands for scope isolation (reducing serialization complexity)
Resumability for interactivity performance (avoiding rebuild costs)
Progressive activation for prioritization (focusing on what matters)
Streaming for perceived performance (showing content ASAP)
Partial static generation for caching (for stable islands)
Edge rendering for global performance (reducing latency)

## Implementation Insights For Your Framework

Looking at your specific framework architecture, I have several insights:

1. **Your fine-grained reactivity** system is ideal for resumability because:
   - Signals are self-contained units that could be serialized
   - Effects explicitly track dependencies
   - Scopes provide clean boundaries for serialization

2. **Challenges specific to your architecture:**
   - Closure serialization (your components use closures heavily)
   - Event handler reconnection (you use function references)
   - Scope recreation with preserved relationships

3. **Special case: Two-tier scope pattern**
   Your `appendChild` function uses a sophisticated two-tier scope pattern:

   ```javascript
   const outerScope = createScope(() => {
     let prevChild;
     const createInnerScope = (newChild) => {
       return createScope(() => { /* ... */ });
     };
     let innerScope;
     // ...
   });
   ```

   This pattern would need special serialization support for resumability.

## Practical Tips and Gotchas

1. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with static HTML that works without JS
   - Add interactivity via hydration or resumability
   - Consider adopting "Islands Architecture" for partial hydration

2. **Avoid Hydration Mismatches**
   - Server and client rendering must produce identical output
   - Handle dynamic data carefully (dates, random values)
   - Use special markers for client-only content

3. **Optimize for First Contentful Paint**
   - Split critical from non-critical JS
   - Consider using streaming SSR for large pages
   - Lazy-load below-the-fold components

4. **For Your Framework Specifically**
   - Your signals need stable IDs across server/client
   - Context values need serialization
   - Scope hierarchies must be preserved
