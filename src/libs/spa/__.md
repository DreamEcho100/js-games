You've created a **type-safe JSX-like DOM creation library** in plain JavaScript with support for **namespaces** (SVG, MathML, XHTML), **proxy-based element factories**, and **fine-grained attribute handling**. Seriously impressive work ‚Äî this is rich, elegant, and extensible.

Let me break down some highlights and maybe offer a few thoughts or ideas if you're open:

---

### ‚úÖ **What You‚Äôve Nailed**

- **Type-flexible props and children:** You handle primitives, arrays, and nested structures gracefully.
- **Unified attribute handling**:
  - `dataSet`, `ariaSet`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and `style` are all custom-parsed.
  - `ref` logic supports both function and object refs.
- **Namespaced tag creation** is **compositional and strongly typed** ‚Äî `tagNS`, `tagNSFactory`, and `tagsProxy(SVG_NS)` kind of mimic the ergonomics of JSX factories.
- **Proxy-based lazy tag factory** ‚Äì avoids predefining every tag. Smart use of caching.
- **Attribute-event map inference** for event handlers via `"onClick"`-like syntax tied to DOM event maps.

### üí° Suggestions (Optional)

1. **Custom Element Support**
   - Consider extending `tag` to support `is` for customized built-ins:

     ```ts
     document.createElement(tagName, { is: attributes?.is });
     ```

2. **Event Options**
   - Support `{ passive: true }` or `{ once: true }` via something like:

     ```ts
     element.addEventListener("click", handler, { passive: true });
     ```

3. **Hydration / Diffing (Optional Path)**
   - If you ever move toward SSR or hydration, a diffing system on top of this would be a natural next evolution.

4. **`Fragment` Support**
   - For multi-root returns (like React Fragments), consider a special tag like:

     ```ts
     tag("fragment", null, child1, child2)
     ```

     And handle it with `DocumentFragment`.

5. **Prop Filtering**
   - For unintentional props leaking into DOM (like a `key`, or app-level props), add optional filtering.

6. **Dev Mode Warnings**
   - Catch invalid tag names or props during dev builds via `console.warn` or a linter plugin.

### üåê Bonus Idea

Expose an ES module entry point like:

```js
import { tagsProxy as h } from "xspa-dom";
```

Now your entire DOM creation API becomes `h.div({ class: "container" }, ...)` or `h(SVG_NS).circle({ cx: 50, cy: 50, r: 40 })`.

### Final Thoughts

This would make a **phenomenal foundation** for a lightweight custom JSX pragma, static site generator, or even a virtual DOM renderer (with diff/patch).

If you're using this for a real project, what kind of app or tooling are you building with it? I'd love to hear more and can help brainstorm next steps if you're game.
