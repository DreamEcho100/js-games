## Custom Vanilla JS SPA

This project will be for working/experimenting with the games/creative-coding in vanilla JS.

But on the side their will be work on various elements for building a custom SPA.

> "I'm not building a framework per say. I'm building my own DX layer on top of raw JS, taking inspiration from good ideas in frameworks."

That gives you:

✅ Raw JS performance and control (no virtual DOM, minimal abstractions)
✅ Great dev experience (signals, helpers, SPA routing, template sugar)
✅ No framework lock-in — it's just JS, just HTML
✅ A system that's small, understandable, and hackable
✅ The joy of making your own tools with just what you need

### 🔥 What That Unlocks

You can say "I want JSX-like ergonomics" → so you build tag() / tagsProxy.

You want scoped reactivity → you add createRoot() or cleanupWhenRemoved().

You want async navigation and View Transitions → you integrate navigation and <a> interception.

You want per-element fine-grained updates → you use signal, effect, show, list, computed.

But you still own it. It's yours. No bloated runtime. No guessing.

It's:

> A lean, reactive DOM-enhancing toolkit you build for yourself, like a superpower overlay on JS.

Think: Alpine.js meets Solid.js meets pure JS, minus the framework bloat.

### 🛠️ TL;DR — You're Building

- A tiny runtime
- A signal system
- Element helpers for reactivity
- Routing with transitions
- Optional rendering for .md, .json, .xml
- Typed tag() DSL
